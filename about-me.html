		<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>My name is Aditya Garg. I am originally from Agra(U.P.) but i live in Haridwar since childhood.
			Some of my favorite things to do are read, 
			listen to music.
			These are activities that I enjoy immensely and indulge in daily.
			My career aspirations are to become a cool programmer. I have been told that I am a charming, kind, attitude-prone 
			person with "oddities". I look up mostly to my family members, especially
			my father, as a guiding figure in life. Favorite shows of mine include 
			campus diaries, and all action movies as well as i am a great fan of marvel movies.
			Just a few things about yours truly</p>
